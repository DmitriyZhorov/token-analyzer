# Token-Craft v1.1.0 Release Notes 🚀

**Release Date:** February 12, 2026
**Anthropic Alignment:** 100/100 ✅ (UP from 95/100)
**Breaking Changes:** None - seamless upgrade!

---

## 🎉 Major Milestone: 100% Anthropic Alignment Achieved!

**Your Question:** "Why not 100/100?"

**Our Answer:** We've added the 3 missing Anthropic best practices to reach perfect alignment!

---

## ✨ What's New

### 1. Three New Anthropic Best Practices (75 points)

#### XML Tags Usage (20 points)
- **Detects:** `<document>`, `<task>`, `<context>`, `<example>` tags
- **Anthropic Says:** "Structure document content with XML tags"
- **Your Benefit:** Improved prompt clarity and Claude's parsing accuracy

#### Chain of Thought (30 points)
- **Detects:** "step by step", "let's think", "reasoning:", "because"
- **Anthropic Says:** "Let Claude think (chain of thought)"
- **Your Benefit:** Better reasoning quality and accuracy on complex tasks

#### Examples/Few-Shot (25 points)
- **Detects:** "for example", "e.g.", "such as", "here's an example"
- **Anthropic Says:** "Use examples (multishot prompting)"
- **Your Benefit:** Fewer iterations, more accurate outputs

**Total New Points:** 75 (bringing Optimization Adoption from 250 → 325)

### 2. Flexible Pricing System 💰

**Your Request:**
> "Most of us use Sonnet 4.5 or Opus 4.6 via Bedrock or Direct API. Make pricing flexible as models and prices change."

**What We Built:**

#### `pricing_config.json` - Pricing Database
```json
{
  "direct_api": {
    "claude-opus-4-6": {"input": $15, "output": $75},
    "claude-sonnet-4-5": {"input": $3, "output": $15},
    "claude-haiku-4-5": {"input": $0.80, "output": $4}
  },
  "aws_bedrock": {
    "claude-sonnet-4-5": {
      "input": $6,
      "output": $30,
      "batch_input": $3,
      "batch_output": $15
    }
  }
}
```

#### `pricing_calculator.py` - Cost Engine
- Calculate session costs
- Monthly estimates
- Savings projections
- Deployment comparisons
- Easy to use standalone!

**Validated Pricing:**
- ✅ Direct API: From Anthropic documentation
- ✅ AWS Bedrock: Confirmed via WebFetch (Feb 12, 2026)
- ✅ Google Vertex: Limited availability (custom quotes)

### 3. Updated Scoring Weights

**Optimized for Quality + Efficiency:**

| Category | v1.0 | v1.1 | Change | Reason |
|----------|------|------|--------|--------|
| Token Efficiency | 350 (35%) | 300 (30%) | ↓ -50 | Quality matters too |
| Optimization Adoption | 250 (25%) | 325 (32.5%) | ↑ +75 | More best practices |
| Self-Sufficiency | 200 (20%) | 200 (20%) | - | Unchanged |
| Improvement Trend | 150 (15%) | 125 (12.5%) | ↓ -25 | Rebalanced |
| Best Practices | 50 (5%) | 50 (5%) | - | Unchanged |

**Net Effect:** More emphasis on **doing things right**, not just **doing things cheaply**.
